# <h1 align="center" id="heading">Week 2 - Deploying a Face Emotion Detector on AWS Lambda</h1>

## üõçÔ∏è Overview
Humans have always had the innate ability to recognize and distinguish between faces. Now computers are able to do the same. This opens up tons of applications. Face detection and Recognition can be used to improve access and security, allow payments to be processed without physical cards, enable criminal identification and allow personalized healthcare and other services. Face detection and recognition is a heavily researched topic and there are tons of resources online.

In today's session, we'll be taking a look at face detection and emotion interpretation. Our goal will be to detect the faces in an image and identify the emotions those faces portray. To do this, we'll need some tools!

Facial detection is the first part of our pipeline. We have used the [Open-CV](https://opencv.org/) python library for Face Recognition using the [Haar Cascade object detection algorithm](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades) that we found easy to install and very accurate in detecting faces. This library scans the input image and returns the bounding box coordinates of all detected faces. You will work on writing the code to implement this algorithm in `emotions.py`.

We then will utilize a pre-trained model and create the associated layers in a python class. This will allow us to utilize the model to make our predictions. You will work on writing the code to implement the layers for this class in `emotions.py`

We will then prepare [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) to work with AWS Lambda. You will build your application using SAM's `build` function. This will utilize [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to prepare your application to be uploaded to the Elastic Container Registry (ECR). The ECR is a repository for Docker or other containers, which we will discuss more further in Week 4.

After, we'll navigate to ECR on AWS to create our own private registry. We will then use SAM's `deploy` function to push our image to ECR and deploy our function on AWS Lambda. The resulting endpoint will be used to make an inference using Postman about our input image.


## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Implement and utilize pre-trained models for your own project
- Utilize Docker to build an Image of your application and  upload to ECR
- Use the SAM CLI tool to work with AWS Lambda
- Deploy your application on AWS Lambda to make predictions

## üì¶ Deliverables
- Make the project public on your GitHub
- Submit your repo link on Canvas
- Submit a image prediction of your deployed model

## AWS Lambda
####  What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless infrastructure and computing services. This means you do not need to acquire a server or any other infrastructure. The coder simply writes the code, uploads it, and runs it. It is part of core compute services (EC2, EBS, ELB, Lambda) proved by AWS. Amazon manages the computer power, but it is serverless from our perspective. AWS handles all the underlying infrastructure, deployment of code, and scaling.

#### What languages are supported by AWS Lambda?

python, Java, node.js, and C#

#### Example usage of AWS Lambda

Whenever you upload files, you want to create thumbnails automatically. AWS Lambda can do this for you. Every time you upload files, a Lambda function is called and thumbnail is generated. Other uses include:

- scheduled tasks
- microservices
- event handlers
- replace simple applications
- custom near real-time process of logs
- respond to events generated by S3

#### Billing for AWS Lambda

Pay for compute time per 100ms. Never pay for idle resources.

#### How do you use AWS Lambda?

1.) Create functions through inline editor or upload zip file.
- Start a function
- Define runtime settings
- Define memory limit
- Define execution time out

2.) Invoke those functions through CLI or SDK, or events

3.) The code is usually event-driven


## The Program

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the SAM CLI. It includes the following files and folders.

- app.py - Code for the application's Lambda function and Project Dockerfile.
- events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- tests - Unit tests for the application code.
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda functions and an API Gateway API. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.

## Deploying the Sample Application

The Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for building and testing Lambda applications. It uses Docker to run your functions in an Amazon Linux environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate your application's build environment and API.

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

- SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)

You may need the following for local testing.

- [Python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To build and deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

The first command will build a docker image from a Dockerfile and then copy the source of your application inside the Docker image. The second command will package and deploy your application to AWS, with a series of prompts:

- **Stack Name**: The name of the stack to deploy to CloudFormation. This should be unique to your account and region, and a good starting point would be something matching your project name.
- **AWS Region**: The AWS region you want to deploy your app to.
- **Confirm changes before deploy**: If set to yes, any change sets will be shown to you before execution for manual review. If set to no, the AWS SAM CLI will automatically deploy application changes.
- **Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation**: Many AWS SAM templates, including this example, create AWS IAM roles required for the AWS Lambda function(s) included to access AWS services. By default, these are scoped down to minimum required permissions. To deploy an AWS CloudFormation stack which creates or modifies IAM roles, the `CAPABILITY_IAM` value for `capabilities` must be provided. If permission isn't provided through this prompt, to deploy this example you must explicitly pass `--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM` to the `sam deploy` command.
- **Save arguments to samconfig.toml**: If set to yes, your choices will be saved to a configuration file inside the project, so that in the future you can just re-run `sam deploy` without parameters to deploy changes to your application.

You can find your API Gateway Endpoint URL in the output values displayed after deployment.

## Use the SAM CLI to Build and Test Locally

Build your application with the `sam build` command.

```bash
facebot$ sam build
```

The SAM CLI builds a docker image from a Dockerfile and then installs dependencies defined in `requirements.txt` inside the docker image. The processed template file is saved in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
facebot$ sam local invoke FaceSentimentFunction --event events/event.json
```

The SAM CLI can also emulate your application's API. Use the `sam local start-api` to run the API locally on port 3000.

```bash
facebot$ sam local start-api
facebot$ curl http://localhost:3000/
```

The SAM CLI reads the application template to determine the API's routes and the functions that they invoke. The `Events` property on each function's definition includes the route and method for each path.

```yaml
      Events:
        Root:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /
            Method: ANY
```

## Add a Resource to Your Application

The application template uses AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to define application resources. AWS SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring common serverless application resources such as functions, triggers, and APIs. For resources not included in [the SAM specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md), you can use standard [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) resource types.

## Fetch, Tail, and Filter Lambda Function Logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
facebot$ sam logs -n sentiment-analysis --stack-name facebot --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Unit Tests

Tests are defined in the `tests` folder in this project. Use PIP to install the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and run unit tests from your local machine.

```bash
facebot$ pip install pytest pytest-mock --user
facebot$ python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name facebot
```

## Resources

See the [AWS SAM developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) for an introduction to SAM specification, the SAM CLI, and serverless application concepts.
